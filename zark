They tell the story of how in the far future, 'My name is Jeff' vine compilations will bring about the end times. You probably should have read up on some history before delving into the depths and used the forbidden magicks of 'vineomancy', a magical practice banned in early 2017 AD, the fabled 'year of respite' after 2016 AD, 'the year no one liked'. Your misuse of this sacred yet forbidden art has now brought about the third apocalypse event and possibly the worst humanity has faced within the past 4 years. G A M E  O V E R.");
